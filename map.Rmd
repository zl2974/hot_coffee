## For those who look for our project, we are sorry that the map is **shutted down**. 

The key API provider has terminated their service so the map can no longer function. But the source code is [here](https://github.com/zl2974/risky_coffee) and the idea is simple: PRESENT YOUR DATA IN A NICE AND INTERATIVE WAY.

Good luck with the final project, and anyone want to fix or improve our project are more than welcome to email me.
