Risky Coffee? Or…Not?

# Motivation

![Tweets](./file/tweets.png)

 You temporarily parked in front of your office building to buy a cup of
coffee in a side-walk cafe. A parking ticket warrior walked to your car,
raised her scanner, and fired an invisible beam of light at your
registration. She handed you a NYC parking ticket and that beam of light
cost you $115.

 According to statistics, New Yorkers drink 6.7 times the amount of
coffee compared to average, and the average price consumers are paying
for a cup of coffee is $2.99, but consider the above, do you think you
really only paid a few bucks on your coffee?

# Intended final product

 A report regarding the distribution and relationship of cafe and
parking violation, and a cool shiny app helps citizens to find the
nearest location to have a cup of coffee without receiving a ticket.

# Data source

  - [Open Parking and Camera
    Violations](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Open-Parking-and-Camera-Violations/nc67-uf89)
  - [Parking Violations Issued - Fiscal
    Year 2021](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2021/pvqr-7yc4)
    -[Sidewalk Café Licenses and
    Applications](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Business/Sidewalk-Caf-Licenses-and-Applications/qcdj-rwhu)

# Research questions

 In this project, we are interested in using quantitative data to assess
whether streets with cafes are easier to generate parking tickets and
how much fine- amount are possibly associated with coffee. We are also
interested in the association between parking violations and time period
during a day and different boroughs.

# Analysis/Visualizations

# Anticipate Challenge

1.  Although all data come from NYC open data, challenges can still
    emerge as they did not come from the same department and thus
    identity of the subjects, location name can vary.

2.  Matching the violation location and coffee on to the map can be
    difficult, because all these information is marked by STREET, and we
    need to find the longitude and latitude information separately

3.  The Shiny app we plan to develop has at least 2 paths of
    interaction, meaning we need at least 2 modules to produce A to B
    and B to A. It can be coding intensive and might only finish one
    module by the time of Due.
