## Data Processing

\ We set NYC Open Data as primary data source, and required:

1. Open Parking and Camera Violations
1. Parking Violations Issued - Fiscal Year 2021
1. Sidewalk Caf√© Licenses and Applications

from NYC Open Data.

\ With these data, we first clean all variable names and select target variables for comparison 
between data, as well as changing variable types to reflecting their actual value.
Then we focus on acquiring geometric information via available 
information in the datasets. We wrote a function to pull geometric information 
from [Geosearch](https://labs-geosearch-docs.netlify.app/). 
Third, we identified violation in a certain range of area, and nest them to the
 location we interested.
