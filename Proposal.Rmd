<h1><center>Risky Coffee? Or...Not?</center></h1>
<h2><center>Examing the risk of parking violation in different boroughs in NYC</center></h2>

# Motivation

![Tweets](./file/tweets.png)

\ You temporarily parked in front of your office building to buy a cup of coffee in a side-walk cafe. A parking ticket warrior walked to your car, raised her scanner, and fired an invisible beam of light at your registration. She handed you a NYC parking ticket and that beam of light cost you $115.

\ According to statistics, New Yorkers drink 6.7 times the amount of coffee compared to average, and the average price consumers are paying for a cup of coffee is $2.99, but consider the above, do you think you really only paid a few bucks on your coffee? 

# Intended final product

\ A report regarding the distribution and relationship of cafe and parking violation, and a cool shiny app helps citizens to find the nearest location to have a cup of coffee without receiving a ticket.

# Data source

- [Open Parking and Camera Violations](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Open-Parking-and-Camera-Violations/nc67-uf89)
- [Parking Violations Issued - Fiscal Year 2021](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2021/pvqr-7yc4)
- [Sidewalk Café Licenses and Applications](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Business/Sidewalk-Caf-Licenses-and-Applications/qcdj-rwhu)

# Research questions

\ In this project, we are interested in using quantitative data to assess whether streets with cafes are easier to generate parking tickets and how much fine- amount are possibly associated with boroughs. We are also interested in the association between parking violations and time period during a day and different boroughs.

# Analysis/Visualizations

\ We want to use Logistic regression to analyze association between Cafe and parking violations in different locations and time periods, and figuring out the real price of a cup of coffee.  We expect to use plots (e.g. scatterplots, line plots) to demonstrate our results.Here’s our expected result:  

1. A line plot of trends in parking violations in NYC.  
2. A box plot of fine-amount in different boroughs.  
3. A scatterplot of cafe distribution in NYC.  
4. A map of Violation Counts.  
5. A map of Violation fine amounts.  

\ Meanwhile, we hope to apply the analysis results on the map of NYC, showing our suggestions for NY citizens about parking and coffee consumption.   



# Anticipate Challenge

1. Although all data come from NYC open data, challenges can still emerge as they did not come from the same department and thus identity of the subjects, location name can vary.

2. Matching the violation location and coffee on to the map can be difficult, because all these information is marked by STREET, and we need to find the longitude and latitude information separately

3. The Shiny app we plan to develop has at least 2 paths of interaction, meaning we need at least  2 modules to produce A to B and B to A. It can be coding intensive and might only finish one module by the time of Due.
